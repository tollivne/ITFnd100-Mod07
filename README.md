# Working with Binary Files & Structured Error Handling
**Dev:** *N. Tolliver*  
**Date:** *6.1.2020*

The purpose of this post is discuss the uses of "pickling" to read and write binary files in Python and to discuss how "structured error  handling" can be used to create a more user-friendly experience and to encourage developers to try to anticipate ways in which the program might happen if it is used in a manner other than that which the developer originally intended.

Note:  The original paper contained verbiage to explain how to create a GitHub webpage, how to rename a file on GitHub, and how to use markdown language.  That section was removed so the GitHub website could focus only on pickling and structured error handling.
