## Introduction

One of the problems a user may experience is that their program runs as expected in PyCharm but then gives an error message when running in a command window.  This can be caused by trying to read a file using a reference to its relative path.  PyCharm looks for the file in the same directory as your program; however, in the command window, one has to change directories before running the program in order for it to locate the file using its relative path.

This can lead to a lot of frustration because the standard error message will just say that the file is not found although, in PyCharm, the file was found.  The solution to this problem will be used to demonstrate the use of "structured error handling" using a custom error message.  There are two types of error messages in Python.  One type is an error that occurs when the developer is writing the program.  It is called a "syntax" error.  The other type ouccurs when the program is running and is called a "run time" error or an "exception."  Here is an example of a simple example of code written to read a "TODO list" from a file, allow the user to add or remove items, and then store the data back into the file.
