# Assignment 7
# Working with Binary Files & Structured Error Handling
**Dev:** *N. Tolliver*  
**Date:** *5.28.2020*

## Introduction

This assignment involves working with GitHub, demonstrating how to work with binary files using Python’s pickling module, and how to work with exception handling.    Pickling is a method of reading and writing to and from a binary file using one of Python’s built-in modules.  The syntax and the reasoning behind using pickling will be discussed.  Following that, structured error handling will be discussed.  Structured error handling provides a way for the developer to show user-friendly error messages to the user and makes the developer think of ways in which the user could “break” the program.  It can also help guide the troubleshooting process as it could provide information on where the error was encountered by treeing through various levels of structured errors with the general error being placed at the end.  Lastly, using GitHub is an integral part of this assignment, so the methodology for GitHub will also be included in this document.

## Using the Pickling Module in Python
Pickling refers to the process of converting python data into binary.  It is also known as “serialization” or “marshalling” or “flattening.”  Unpickling refers to the process of converting binary data back into a Python object.  To “pickle” or convert a Python object to binary, you call the dump() function.  To unpickle the binary data, you call the load() function.  An excellent website for explaining and providing the syntax for the pickling module is the official Python software website:  (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html, 5.30.2020, External).  This is a reliable website that can be trusted to be very accurate and updated for the most recent versions of Python.  Although it is very accurate, it can be a bit challenging for a beginner to understand.  The pickle dump and load syntax from this website is shown in Figure 1.
