# Assignment 7
**Dev:** *N. Tolliver*  
**Date:** *5.28.2020*

## Introduction

This assignment involves working with GitHub, demonstrating how to work with binary files using Python’s pickling module, and how to work with exception handling.    Pickling is a method of reading and writing to and from a binary file using one of Python’s built-in modules.  The syntax and the reasoning behind using pickling will be discussed.  Following that, structured error handling will be discussed.  Structured error handling provides a way for the developer to show user-friendly error messages to the user and makes the developer think of ways in which the user could “break” the program.  It can also help guide the troubleshooting process as it could provide information on where the error was encountered by treeing through various levels of structured errors with the general error being placed at the end.  Lastly, using GitHub is an integral part of this assignment, so the methodology for GitHub will also be included in this document.

## Learning Objectives
The following learning objectives were useful in understanding this module.  

### What is the Markdown language? 
Markdown is a easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/, 5.30.2020, External).  When you write code in markdown it will get converted into hypertext markup language (html) which is used to create content for the web.  In contrast to html, markdown uses regular words (plain text) with added formatting characters so it is easier to read and easier to write than html code.  The markdown “parser” converts markdown to html.  Files have the extension “.md” for markdown language (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JwKbeKnhMk, 5.30.2020, External).  It is used for the readme.md file on GitHub and the index.md.  An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can be used to write in the markdown language.  Some of the IDEs are Microsoft Visual Studio (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/, 5.30.2020, External), Markdown Pad (http://markdownpad.com/, 5.30.2020, External), and Typora (https://typora.io/, 5.30.2020, External).  Typora uses the GitHub flavored version of markdown, and live preview.  For a more detailed discussion on some of the history of markdown language and markdown editors, this is a useful website:  (https://www.oberlo.com/blog/markdown-editors, 5.20.2020, External)

### How do you use Markdown on a GitHub webpage? 
To use markdown on a GitHub webpage you type in the code using plain text with symbols to indicate the formatting that you would like.  For example, # is used for a level 1 heading, ### is used for a level 2 heading, and ### would be used for a level 3 heading with progressively smaller fonts.  To make the text italicized, you enclose it in a single asterisk or single underscores.  You can use double asterisks or double underlines for strong text.  Double tilde encloses text for the strikethrough font.  Triple hyphens or triple underscores can be used for a horizontal line.  Like Python, if you want to show the actual characters, you can escape them using a \.  Git is the actual version control software.  GitHub is the website used for version control and collaboration.  A great website for explaining GitHub in very non-technical terms is (https://youtu.be/BCQHnlnPusY, 5.30.2020, External).  He explains using GitHub for version control for a poem, so it was non-technical and very easy to understand the basic concepts.  It was awesome for a beginner!

To post a link, you enclose the text you want to display in brackets [], and beside it, the link goes in parentheses.  To display an image, the text you want to display is placed in brackets [], the location of the image goes in parentheses.  For a code block, you put the ```python on the line before the code and the ``` characters on the line after the code.  This website explains a lot of the syntax that will be used for creating the markdown code (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo, 5.30.2020, External). 

## Creating the GitHub WebPage
GitHub is a version control system (VCS) initially created in 2005 for tracking changes to computer code (https://youtu.be/SWYqp7iY_Tc, 5.30.2020, External).  It can be used for code written in any computer language as it is simply a file storage & version control platform.  First you must create a “repository” on Git.  A repository is like a “project” in Python.  A commit on GitHub is a record of what files you have changed since the last time you made a commit.  When you make changes to your repository (repo), you instruct Git to put those files into your commit history.  Commits allow you to go back to the state of a project at any point in time.  For this assignment, I started with “Lessons Learned” from the previous assignment.  I wrote the markdown code shown in Figure 1 in my docs.index.md file on GitHub (https://tollivne.github.io/ITFnd100-Mod06/, 5.30.2020 External)
